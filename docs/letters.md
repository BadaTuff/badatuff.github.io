# Weekly Letters

## OSCP + BTL1 Learning Journey

Every week I publish a detailed letter documenting what I'm learning across both OSCP and BTL1 certifications. Each letter combines technical concepts, practical examples, and real-world applications for SOC/Blue-Team roles.

### What's in Each Letter?

- **OSCP Section**: Methodology, enumeration techniques, exploitation concepts, and lab walkthroughs
- **BTL1 Section**: Detection engineering, log analysis, incident response, and blue team fundamentals
- **Practical Examples**: Scripts, runbooks, detection rules, and real-world applications
- **Reflections**: Challenges faced, lessons learned, and how concepts connect

### Letter Archive

Letters are organized from newest to oldest. Each represents one week of focused learning and practical work.
