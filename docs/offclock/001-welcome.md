# Welcome to Off the Clock

## The Side of BTuff Beyond the Terminal

This is where I step away from the cybersecurity grind and share thoughts on life, growth, challenges, and everything in between.

### Why "Off the Clock"?

Security work is intense. It requires focus, discipline, and constant learning. But there's more to life than CVEs, exploit chains, and log analysis.

This section is for:
- **Life lessons** learned while pursuing certs and career goals
- **Mental health & balance** - dealing with burnout, imposter syndrome, the grind
- **Personal growth** - habits, mindset shifts, failures and wins
- **Real talk** - unfiltered thoughts on whatever's on my mind
- **Random interests** - fitness, productivity, books, whatever I'm into

Some posts will be long and reflective. Others will be short and casual. There's no schedule here - just authentic thoughts when I have something worth sharing.

### The Connection

Even though this content isn't strictly cybersecurity, it's still relevant. Breaking into this field requires more than technical skills - it requires persistence, resilience, and the ability to keep going when things get tough.

If you're on a similar journey, hopefully these reflections help you stay motivated and remind you that you're not alone.
