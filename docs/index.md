# Welcome to BTuff Security

## Breaking Into Cybersecurity Through Persistence

Hey! I'm **Muhiz "BTuff" Bada**, a 19-year-old documenting my journey from student to SOC/Blue-Team Analyst in real-time. Every week I publish practical security work while pursuing Security Blue Team's BTL1 certification.

### What Makes This Different?

- **Evidence Over Polish** - You'll see the mistakes, the fixes, and the real learning process
- **Practical & Applicable** - Every concept is tied to real-world SOC/Blue-Team work
- **Consistent Weekly Output** - New content every week, no matter what
- **Teaching to Learn** - I explain what I'm learning to deepen my understanding

### 📘 Latest Weekly Letter (Cybersecurity)

**Week 04 - From Suspicious Email to Verdict: My Phishing Analysis Workflow**

*Newly published! December 16, 2025*

**Topics covered:**
- The artifact collection process (email, web, and file artifacts)
- SPF, DKIM, and DMARC - the email authentication trio
- Reputation tools and sandboxing (VirusTotal, URLScan, Hybrid Analysis, PhishTool)
- My complete phishing analysis playbook with step-by-step workflow
