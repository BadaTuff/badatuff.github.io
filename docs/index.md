# Welcome to BTuff Security

## Breaking Into Cybersecurity Through Persistence

Hey! I'm **Muhiz "BTuff" Bada**, a 19-year-old documenting my journey from student to SOC/Blue-Team Analyst in real-time. Every week I publish practical security work while pursuing Security Blue Team's BTL1 certification.

### What Makes This Different?

- **Evidence Over Polish** - You'll see the mistakes, the fixes, and the real learning process
- **Practical & Applicable** - Every concept is tied to real-world SOC/Blue-Team work
- **Consistent Weekly Output** - New content every week, no matter what
- **Teaching to Learn** - I explain what I'm learning to deepen my understanding

## Latest Updates

### 📘 Latest Weekly Letter (Cybersecurity)

**Week 05 - I Scanned My Home Network and Found More Than I Expected**

*Newly published! December 26, 2025*

I took a break from BTL1 to actually secure my home network. Ran a full nmap scan, found over 20 devices and real vulnerabilities on my printers. Set up network segmentation with an ASUS router, implemented defense-in-depth strategies, and learned the real-world tradeoffs of practical security.

**Topics covered:**
- Running nmap vulnerability scans on home networks
- Network segmentation with VLANs (Professional, Kids, IoT, Guest networks)
- Fixing printer vulnerabilities (Slowloris DoS, CSRF, JetDirect exposure)
- Defense-in-depth with ACLs, firewall rules, and isolation

### 🌱 Latest Off the Clock (Life & Growth)

**The Humbling Experience of Learning Content Creation**

4 hours of recording for 8 minutes of content. 10 hours of editing. The reality check of stepping into an unknown field and realizing how much you don't know. My first video taught me more about persistence and learning than any tutorial could.

- Practical lab examples and walkthroughs
- How to apply skills to real SOC/Blue-Team roles
- Challenges faced and lessons learned

### Off the Clock (Life & Growth)
Unscheduled, authentic posts on the non-technical side of the journey:
- Mental health and maintaining balance

## Why "Evidence Over Polish"?

In cybersecurity, demonstrating capability matters more than perfect presentation. I'm building a portfolio of real work that shows:

1. **Consistency** - Showing up every week
2. **Problem-Solving** - Working through challenges
3. **Communication** - Explaining technical concepts clearly
4. **Initiative** - Self-directed learning and research
5. **Persistence** - The #1 skill for breaking into cyber
