# Welcome to BTuff Security

## Breaking Into Cybersecurity Through Persistence

Hey! I'm **Muhiz "BTuff" Bada**, and I'm documenting my journey from student to SOC/Blue-Team Analyst in real-time. Every week I publish practical security work while pursuing OSCP and Security Blue Team's BTL1 certification simultaneously.

### What Makes This Different?

- **Evidence Over Polish** - You'll see the mistakes, the fixes, and the real learning process
- **Practical & Applicable** - Every concept is tied to real-world SOC/Blue-Team work
- **Consistent Weekly Output** - New content every week, no matter what
- **Teaching to Learn** - I explain what I'm learning to deepen my understanding
