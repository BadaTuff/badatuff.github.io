## Muhiz "BTuff" Bada

Blue-Team focused security analyst in training.

I'm finishing a B.S. in Computer Science (InfoSec concentration) at Southern New Hampshire University with a 3.8 GPA (graduating March 2026). I'm incredibly grateful for Walmart's Live Better U program, which is covering my tuition and making this education possible. Currently pursuing Security Blue Team's BTL1 certification while documenting my journey to a SOC/Blue-Team Analyst role.

### Certifications

- CompTIA Security+
- CompTIA Network+
- Google Cybersecurity Certificate

### My Mission

Prove that breaking into cybersecurity is 100% possible - even in a tough job market - with the #1 skill you need to succeed: **persistence**.

Every week I publish practical security work: runbooks, detections, scripts, and real-world lab examples. I teach what I learn to deepen my understanding and show how these skills apply to actual SOC/Blue-Team roles. I leverage modern tools including AI to accelerate research, automate workflows, and enhance my analysis.

### YouTube

- **Real-World Applications**: How these skills translate to actual SOC/Blue-Team work
- **Mistakes & Fixes**: The learning process, not just the polished results

### Why Study in Public?

1. **Accountability** - Committing publicly keeps me consistent
2. **Teaching Reinforces Learning** - Explaining concepts solidifies understanding
3. **Building Proof** - Demonstrating capability through real work
4. **Helping Others** - If one person finds this useful, it's worth it
