# Weekly Letters

## BTL1 Learning Journey

Every week I publish a detailed letter documenting what I'm learning through the BTL1 certification. Each letter combines technical concepts, practical examples, and real-world applications for SOC/Blue-Team roles.

### What's in Each Letter?

- **Blue Team Fundamentals**: Detection engineering, log analysis, incident response, and defensive security
- **Practical Examples**: Scripts, runbooks, detection rules, and real-world applications
- **Reflections**: Challenges faced, lessons learned, and how concepts connect

### Letter Archive

Letters are organized from newest to oldest. Each represents one week of focused learning and practical work.

## Latest Letter

### **[Week 05 - I Scanned My Home Network and Found More Than I Expected →]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link letters/week-05.md %})**

*Newly published! December 26, 2025*

I took a break from BTL1 to actually secure my home network. Ran a full nmap scan, found over 20 devices and real vulnerabilities on my printers. Set up network segmentation with an ASUS router, implemented defense-in-depth strategies, and learned the real-world tradeoffs of practical security.

**Topics covered:**
- Running nmap vulnerability scans on home networks
- Network segmentation with VLANs (Professional, Kids, IoT, Guest networks)
- Fixing printer vulnerabilities (Slowloris DoS, CSRF, JetDirect exposure)
- Defense-in-depth with ACLs, firewall rules, and isolation
- ASUS router security features and home lab setup

### **[Week 03 - AD + Phishing Analysis: Two Pillars of Blue Team Work →]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link letters/week-03.md %})**

This week I finally made it into the phishing analysis section of BTL1! But first, I had to master Active Directory fundamentals. Learn how to investigate compromised accounts with PowerShell, analyze credential harvesting emails, spot typosquatting attacks, and understand Kerberos authentication.

---

### **[Week 02 - Cybersecurity Skills Transfer to the Real World →]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link letters/week-02.md %})**

How I avoided a real-life phishing attempt using cybersecurity training, plus reinforcing key SOC concepts like SIEM, EDR, HIDS/HIPS, Risk Management, and more!

### Why Weekly Letters?

1. **Consistency** - Committing to weekly output builds discipline
2. **Teaching Reinforces Learning** - Explaining concepts deepens understanding
3. **Portfolio Building** - Demonstrating capability through real work
4. **Accountability** - Public commitment keeps me on track

The format combines blog-style reflection with technical tutorial content, showing both the "what" and the "why" behind each concept.
