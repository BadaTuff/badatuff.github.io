# Weekly Letters

## BTL1 Learning Journey

Every week I publish a detailed letter documenting what I'm learning through the BTL1 certification. Each letter combines technical concepts, practical examples, and real-world applications for SOC/Blue-Team roles.

### What's in Each Letter?

- **Blue Team Fundamentals**: Detection engineering, log analysis, incident response, and defensive security
- **Practical Examples**: Scripts, runbooks, detection rules, and real-world applications
- **Reflections**: Challenges faced, lessons learned, and how concepts connect

### Letter Archive

Letters are organized from newest to oldest. Each represents one week of focused learning and practical work.

### Why Weekly Letters?

1. **Consistency** - Committing to weekly output builds discipline
2. **Teaching Reinforces Learning** - Explaining concepts deepens understanding
3. **Portfolio Building** - Demonstrating capability through real work
4. **Accountability** - Public commitment keeps me on track

The format combines blog-style reflection with technical tutorial content, showing both the "what" and the "why" behind each concept.
