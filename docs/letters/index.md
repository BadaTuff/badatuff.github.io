# Weekly Letters

## BTL1 Learning Journey

Every week I publish a detailed letter documenting what I'm learning through the BTL1 certification. Each letter combines technical concepts, practical examples, and real-world applications for SOC/Blue-Team roles.

### What's in Each Letter?

- **Blue Team Fundamentals**: Detection engineering, log analysis, incident response, and defensive security
- **Practical Examples**: Scripts, runbooks, detection rules, and real-world applications
- **Reflections**: Challenges faced, lessons learned, and how concepts connect

### Letter Archive

Letters are organized from newest to oldest. Each represents one week of focused learning and practical work.

### **[Week 06 - Taming the Cable Jungle and Setting Up Pi-hole →]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link letters/week-06.md %})**

*Newly published! January 5, 2026*

This week I tackled cable management and set up Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi. Learn why cable management matters for SOC work, how Pi-hole provides network-wide ad blocking and DNS visibility, and the troubleshooting journey I went through to get the Raspberry Pi working.

**Topics covered:**
- Why cable management matters in IT and security roles
- Setting up Pi-hole on Raspberry Pi for DNS-level blocking
- Network-wide ad blocking, tracker blocking, and DNS visibility
- Troubleshooting Raspberry Pi SD card flashing issues
- How DNS monitoring applies to SOC work

### **[Week 04 - From Suspicious Email to Verdict: My Phishing Analysis Workflow →]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link letters/week-04.md %})**

This week I learned the complete phishing investigation workflow - from collecting artifacts to making the final verdict. I created a comprehensive SOP documenting the entire process, covering email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), reputation tools, sandboxing, and professional report writing.

### **[Week 03 - AD + Phishing Analysis: Two Pillars of Blue Team Work →]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link letters/week-03.md %})**

This week I finally made it into the phishing analysis section of BTL1! But first, I had to master Active Directory fundamentals. Learn how to investigate compromised accounts with PowerShell, analyze credential harvesting emails, spot typosquatting attacks, and understand Kerberos authentication.

### **[Week 02 - Cybersecurity Skills Transfer to the Real World →]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link letters/week-02.md %})**

How I avoided a real-life phishing attempt using cybersecurity training, plus reinforcing key SOC concepts like SIEM, EDR, HIDS/HIPS, Risk Management, and more!

### Why Weekly Letters?

1. **Consistency** - Committing to weekly output builds discipline
2. **Teaching Reinforces Learning** - Explaining concepts deepens understanding
3. **Portfolio Building** - Demonstrating capability through real work
4. **Accountability** - Public commitment keeps me on track

The format combines blog-style reflection with technical tutorial content, showing both the "what" and the "why" behind each concept.
